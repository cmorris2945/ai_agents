#### How It Works Together

1. The analyst **introduces themselves** and asks the **first question**.  
2. The AI **refines the questions** based on **previous answers** to **dig deeper** into the topic.  
3. The process continues until the analyst decides they have **sufficient insights** and ends the interview.

#### Example Use Case

**Topic:** The benefits of LangGraph as an agent framework.  
**Analyst Persona:** Startup Entrepreneur.  

**Generated Questions:**
1. "Hi, I’m Alex, an entrepreneur exploring AI tools for startups. Can you share examples where LangGraph improved workflow efficiency in startups?"  
2. "That’s interesting. Can you explain how LangGraph integrates with existing systems to minimize setup costs?"  
3. "Thank you so much for your help!"  

#### Summary

This code enables an AI analyst to **conduct structured interviews**, starting with an **introduction** and **focused questions**, refining insights along the way. It dynamically adjusts based on **persona, goals, and prior messages**, making it ideal for **deep-dive explorations** of complex topics.
